# PNG -> GIF
> simple app converting png images to gifs


## How To Use
if you are on linux you can just do `pngtogif.py` as an exe <br>
if you are on windows (lol noob) you have to do `python -m pngtogif` instead <br>

-   Setup the structure with `pngtogif.py setup`
-   Step 1, put wanted pngs in the `images` folder
-   Step 2, run `pngtogif.py`
-   Step 3, all gifs in `out/`

### To convert a single image
- run `pngtogif.py path/to/image.png`
- image is in `out/`
